# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Motto: Don‚Äôt let the subject scare you so much you can‚Äôt even start. 

### Day 0-14: January 8-29, 2017

**Progress**: 
I started the 100 day challenge on January 8th but only found [pomello](http://pomelloapp.com/) (pomodoro+trello) records for 15 days so thats where I am starting the count. I had to take off some days for a funeral, travel + conference but I try to make up by doing extra work on other days. So far I have read [HTML Dog guides](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/), some [ShayHowe](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) and tried making some things in [codepen](http://codepen.io/gizemist/posts/popular/), but after reading [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645#.3tx29b9nh) and [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-study-plan-to-cure-javascript-fatigue-8ad3a54f2eb1), I began Wes Bos' [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I will continue to strengthen my understanding of the basics (html/css, flexbox, sass, vanilla js, ES6) and work my way through the FreeCodeCamp frontend track... ALSO I had purchased React for Beginners in *2015* but never started üôÑ so maybe I can work on that too. I think these are the things that will have the biggest impact on achieving my goals for the year. 

**Thoughts**: 
*On Javascript 30*: I am not familiar enough with ES6 syntax to do the projects on my own but I still benefit from working along with the video ‚Äî especially seeing how Wes uses inspector to troubleshoot and reveal methods. The css variable and flexbox lessons were my favorite. I have been taking lots of handwritten notes but I was really inspired by [Meredith's blog](http://blog.meredithunderell.com/tag/javascript30/) which influenced me to use this log. 
Learned a lot of new things like targeting with `data-* attributes` instead of class/id, `transition-timing-function` bezier tool in the inspector, `console.table()`, flexbox, etc etc

### Day 15: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I finished the 7th lesson in [JavaScript30](https://github.com/gizemny/JavaScript30). It was the second array methods exercise. 

**Thoughts:** 
- ... spread operator (to put array inside array)
- => key functions (particularly useful to shorten code) 
- \`${}\` template strings

### Day 16: January 31, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Today returned to my abandoned FreeCodeCamp map; brushed up on basic js and algorithm scripting. 

**Thoughts:** 
The algorithm scripting section is a lot of fun. I got stumped on the recursion one tho. üòï¬†

### Day 17: February 1, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Tried working on the palindrome and some OOP... did not go so well. .

**Thoughts:** 
I redid the recursion one and still don't fully understand but repetition is good. Spent too much time stuck on 1 problem and felt defeated; tried some OOP and bummed out on that too. Next time when I get stuck, I will work through other milestones or switch to JS30.¬†‚ô•Ô∏è Also spent 10 mins crafting a tweet to a bot üôÉ

### Day 18: February 2, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked through many basic js but got stumped on the bonfire. 

**Thoughts:** 
I keep resorting to for loops for every solution. Instead, it needed .map(function(val)) & .charAt().

### Day 19: February 6, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked on some basic bonfires at FCC. 

**Thoughts:** 
I got close to the solution but ended up looking up the answer. Eventually I will reset them all and try again. I have been super busy with guests in town and prepping for our conference, so I have skipped some days :( sorry!

### Day 20: February 10, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
(Yelling from a mountain top) Kicked some algorithm scripting ass at FCC. 

**Thoughts:** 
Using [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/javascript) really helped. I did 2 on my own but peeked on 3rd - so close! Super happy bout tonight. xo

### Day 21: February 11, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked a little bit on FCC but didn't actually solve anything. 

**Thoughts:** 
We were out today celebrating a bday so its hard to code after that.

### Day 22: February 12, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Worked through some challenges on FCC and JS30 lesson. 

**Thoughts:** 
I got really close with one but fumbled because didn't remember this existed: hasOwnProperty() method returns a boolean indicating whether the object has the specified property. Oh you elusive objects! I shall own you someday.

### Day 23: February 13, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Nailed 2 more AlGorethims + submitted my tribute page to Spock today. 

**Thoughts:** 
Reading MDN is starting to make sense. I can also pin-point what to google now when I am stuck. I wanna learn everything. I have 5 basic ones left before JSON + projects begin! SO EXCITED!

### Day 24: February 14, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
I tried my luck at the ones I passed up yesterday but I was way off. Started flexbox lesson. 

**Thoughts:** 
Much to learn - why did I get so hung on a while loop - I guess I never use those. Also 2 variables to store tempprary vars? ü§î Makes sense but did not come naturally. I think I am gonna start incorporating React to my curriculum - time to get crazy! Also Sketch lol Why not!!

### Day 25: February 15, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Started React - intro videos + getting set up. Copy paste lotta components. `Render` is must have in every component. import React always. Using emmet `ctrl + e` to auto complete. 

**Thoughts:** 
Should have done it earlier. Similar to Backbone but with ES6... and hopefully this time I will get a bit more explaination & context! lol

### Day 26: February 16, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Added dynamic data with props. `{this.props}` select component and type `$r` in the console (current component) 

**Thoughts:** 
I have a nice family.

### Day 27: February 17, 2017
Stateless functional component: sometimes components only rendering a header so instead of extending entire React.Component you can store a function inside a variable and pass in props and only keep return.

**Thoughts:** 
I love dogs.

### Day 28: February 18, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Created store name generator with Helper.js functions, learned about constructor to make (this) `.bind` our custom method to the StorePicker component, added  a(onSubmit) `SyntheticEvent` to StorePicker component and URL updates via context + `PropTypes`. 

**Thoughts:** 
Realized my log doesn't have any context as to what I have been learning so I will try to keep that in mind moving forward.

### Day 29: February 19, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
Log missing - Amnesia  

**Thoughts:**

### Day 30: February 21, 2017
**Today's Progress**: 
V sick today. Switched over to ES6. Learned how to shift select items on list. 

**Thoughts:** 
Adding event listeners & looping via forEach. Used `let` as a variable because it is reassigned constantly. querySelectorAll for all the checkboxes. I didn't reaize that you can set something to `this`.
