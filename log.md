# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Motto: Donâ€™t let the subject scare you so much you canâ€™t even start. 

### Day 0-14: January 8-29, 2017

**Progress**: 
I started the 100 day challenge on January 8th but only found [pomello](http://pomelloapp.com/) (pomodoro+trello) records for 15 days so thats where I am starting the count. I had to take off some days for a funeral, travel + conference but I try to make up by doing extra work on other days. So far I have read [HTML Dog guides](http://www.htmldog.com/guides/), some (ShayHowe)[http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/] and tried making some things in [codepen](http://codepen.io/gizemist/posts/popular/), but after reading [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645#.3tx29b9nh) and [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/a-study-plan-to-cure-javascript-fatigue-8ad3a54f2eb1), I began Wes Bos' [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). I will continue to strengthen my understanding of the basics (html/css, flexbox, sass, vanilla js) and work my way through the FreeCodeCamp frontend track... ALSO I had purchased React for Beginners in *2015* but never started ðŸ™„ so maybe I can work on that too. I think these are the things that will have the biggest impact on achieving my goals for the year. 

**Thoughts**: 
*On Javascript 30*: I am not familiar enough with ES6 syntax to do the projects on my own but I still benefit from working along with the video â€” especially seeing how Wes uses inspector to troubleshoot and reveal methods. The css variable and flexbox lessons were my favorite. I have been taking lots of handwritten notes but I was really inspired by [Meredith's blog](http://blog.meredithunderell.com/tag/javascript30/) which influenced me to use this log. 
Learned a lot of new things like targeting with `data-* attributes` instead of class/id, `transition-timing-function` bezier tool in the inspector, `console.table()`, flexbox, etc etc

### Day 15: January 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I finished the 7th lesson in [JavaScript30](https://github.com/gizemny/JavaScript30). It was the second array methods exercise. 

**Thoughts:** 
- ... spread operator (to put array inside array)
- => key functions (particularly useful to shorten code) 
- \`${}\` template strings
